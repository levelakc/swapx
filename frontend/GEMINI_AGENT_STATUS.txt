The Gemini agent is currently blocked.

I am unable to resolve the 'Module not found' error for 'socket.io-client' because I cannot run 'npm install'. The execution environment has security restrictions that prevent me from running 'npm' commands.

To fix the application, please run 'npm install' in the 'SwapX/frontend' directory.

Once the dependencies are installed, I can continue with fixing the messaging functionality and other issues.
